# smart-building-map

Can you create an app that shows buildings in an map (full screen), and that when I click on the buildings it shows the a card on top of the map that displays information about the building derived from proptech sensors. Make sure the map shows Oslo buildings (10 of them). Use dummy data for the the sensor data for now. The pins in the map should be placed in random positions, and they should use a pin icon.
